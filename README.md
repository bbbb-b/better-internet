# Better Internet

Chrome plugin that enhances my internet browsing experience.

# Features:
* Replaces Twitter emojis with text (now everyone looks stupid).

# TODO:
* Replace UTF-8 emojis too.
* Find a cleaner way to do it, rather than going over the whole HTML every x miliseconds. 
* Block YouTube videos shorter than x seconds.
* honestly let ur imagination go wild
