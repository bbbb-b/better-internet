Chrome plugin that enhances my internet browsing experience.

# Features:
* Replaces Twitter emojis with text (now everyone looks stupid).
* Blocks YouTube videos shorter than 2 minutes (time is hardcoded but configurable).

# TODO:
* Replace UTF-8 emojis too.
* Find a cleaner way to do it, rather than going over the whole HTML every x miliseconds. 
* honestly let ur imagination go wild

# Notes:
UnicodeData.txt is from <http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt>
